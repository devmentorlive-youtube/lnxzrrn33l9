# Building a calendar and learning:

- what closures are and how to use them
- separating business and presentation logic
- building javascript generators from scratch
- testing javascript with a REPL

_NOTE_ If you are coming from the FIRST livestream where I got tired
and didnt end with the fix, it is the last commit now. So the fix is in and there is a note explaining what, how, and why. We will be doing this again next Tuesday 7pm Mexico City time!

Please consider supporting my work so I can continue to bring you high
quality content! It's only a buck to you, but it means the world to me.

## Support Mark's work!
